        The region has been inhabited for millennia,[26] but the city was formally founded as the <br>
        fortified village of Kolachi as recently as 1729.[27][28] The settlement greatly increased 
        in importance with the arrival of the East India Company in the mid-19th century. British 
        administrators embarked on substantial projects to transform the city into a major seaport, 
        and connect it with the extensive railway network of the Indian subcontinent.[28] At the time 
        of Pakistan's independence in 1947, the city was the largest in Sindh with an estimated population 
        of 400,000 people.[22] Afterwards, the city experienced a dramatic shift in population and demography 
        with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muslim immigrants (Muhajirs) from India,[29] coupled 
        with a substantial exodus of its Hindu residents.[30] The city experienced rapid economic growth 
        following Pakistan's independence, attracting migrants from throughout the country and other regions 
        in South Asia.[31] According to the 2017 Census of Pakistan, Karachi's total population was 16,051,521, 
        with 14.9 million of those people residing in the urban areas of the city. Karachi is one of the world's 
        fastest-growing cities,[32] and has significant communities representing almost every ethnic group in 
        Pakistan. Karachi holds more than two million Bengali immigrants, a million Afghan refugees, and up 
        to 400,000 Rohingyas from Myanmar.[33][34][35]
